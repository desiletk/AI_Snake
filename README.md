# AI_Snake

Self-project with the goal of continued learning and using of neural network architecture.

A base Snake game was created using Pygame with hopes of first adding a network to train the model used to predict which direction the snake should proceed.

~~Further goals include incorporating a genetic algorithm.~~
 Genetic Algorithm achieved! Also incorporated a visualization of the neural network firing as it plays. Can save weights and load rather than retraining the AI each playthrough.
 
 Next is adding/changing inputs to modify behavior/performance? Maybe give it some sort of angle to food, given the A* shortest distance to the food... TBD
